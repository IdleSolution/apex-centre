## What will it bring us?

* **New legend: Octane**. There is no official date for their arrival, but we would expect them to come right with the start of Season 1!
* **Battle Pass:** Standard battle pass can be bought for 950 Apex Coins ($9.50). However, if you want to unlock 25 tiers straight away, you are free to do so if you pay $28. Respawn confirmed that you can win rewards even if you don't but the battle pass! You will be able to get 1 legendary skin for Octane legend, 5 Apex packs and a lot more!
* **New skins:** You should expect some news skins for your favorite legends!
