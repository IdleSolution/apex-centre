We can say that all the leaks from past weeks about new gun were 100% true. **There is a new gun coming to Apex and its called L-STAR!**

If you paid attention, you could have seen it on the prime loot notification that appeared yesterday:

But that's not everything! Even stats of the new weapon have been leaked and it looks pretty good. Here are some details such as ammo clip size, reload time or fire rate. You can visit <a href='https://rez.gg/apex/weapon/mp_weapon_lstar'>Rez</a> for more information.

## Closer look at L-STAR

The model looks exactly like the one from the leak that was shown weeks ago, so there is no mistake - new gun is coming soon!
