Shroud, one of the biggest streamer of <a target="_blank" href='https://www.twitch.tv/'>Twitch TV</a> has spoken about an important issue every Apex player thinks about since a long time. Yes, the issue here are cheaters. Shroud thinks that **even though Respawn has banned over 500 thousand accounts, they still don't handle it very well.**

"You would not see as many cheaters if this game wasn't free to play" - says Shroud. He touched an important matter most games have to worry about nowadays. While letting people play your game for free and pay for cosmetics later looks like a decent model, it may backfire. Cheating people, when banned, can just make new accounts over and over again. Apex developers, as we wrote <a href='https://www.apex-centre.com/news/over-300k-cheaters-banned/'>here</a> are trying their best to stop them, but it may not be enough and get out of hand very soon.

Shroud, as a former CS:GO pro player, knows how devastating for a game can cheating be. "I'm telling you, the cheaters are gonna ruin this game" - He thinks that as long as Respawn doesn't do better in handling the matter, Apex Legends will be doomed very soon.



## What about you? Do you see cheaters in Apex Legends that often?
