One of the two legends mentioned in the image is already out: Octane. We can assume that the second one will be coming very soon! Besides it, we got information about new elements that will innovate the strategy of the game. It must be something big like a really strong gun or a completely new mechanic that will surprise everybody. Who knows, it may be even dragons <a href='https://www.apex-centre.com/news/dragons-in-apex/'>we wrote about here</a>.



Unfortunately, that's all we know for now, but we will keep on providing you with new information about new legends and items as soon as we get to hear about them.
