Ninja is a famous twitch streamer who has milions of fans following him on social media. His big influence on young gamers is undeniable.



According to Reuters, Ninja's efforts on popularizing Apex Legends were worth a seven-figure sum.

Representatives for EA and Ninja declined to comment on how much he had been paid, but the amount named by the source is a much bigger sum than anyone would have ever thought.



Paying streamers to promote games is not necessary a new thing. Companies have turned to content creators to create hype around their products since gaming content was around. And, as we can see with Apex Legend's example, its a marketing strategy that is working very well. Respawn's game has been steadily increasing since launch and it's not looking like it's gonna stop anytime soon. 



## Do you think its a big amount of money? Was it well-deserved?
