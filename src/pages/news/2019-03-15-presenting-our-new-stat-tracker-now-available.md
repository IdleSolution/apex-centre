In-game stats in game like Apex Legends is a really important thing, and we as gamers know that well. That's why for the past weeks we've been working very hard on our own implementation of a system which allows players to check how they perform!

![Our Tracker](/img/screenshot_2019-03-15-apex-legends-tracker-check-your-stats-3-min.png)



## How does it work?

Saddly, we have a lot of limitations right now. The only stats that are shown on your stats profile are the ones from your Apex banner. Its not a problem we could overcome as we still need to wait for Respawn's API for a full tracker implementation, but we think we made something good enough for now.



## How to unlock your stats

You may have run into problem where you couldn't see any of your stats on our page. No worries, there is an easy fix to that! All you need to do is go to "banner" tab next to "skins" on your profile inside Apex Legends client. Then you just need to unlock the stats you want to be shown. You may have to unlock most of them through packs.



## Plans for the future

We are currently working on a mobile app of our tracker, so stay tuned! Also, right after Respawn Entertainment releases their own API, we will make your in-game stats in much more depth.



## We hope you enjoy our tracker!
