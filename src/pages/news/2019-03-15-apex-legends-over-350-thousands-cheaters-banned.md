Cheaters are a massive problem in the BR genre. Saddly, it the case for Apex Legends, too. Respawn knows it very well and decided to go on a war against them.



## 355,000 cheaters got banned

"We take cheating very seriously and care deeply about the health of 'Apex Legends' for all players.‚Äù - Respawn community manager Jay Frechette says in his Reddit post. He probably knows it's not gonna be easy, though. Just a simple google search can lead to a lot of results that claim to help you with aiming, wall-hacking and a lot more. Of course, we do not encourage you to try and look for them, fair play is always better!

## What's Respawn plan for the future?

They couldn't say much to not to help cheaters prepare for the upcoming patches, but we got some insights directly from Jay:

* We are reaching out and working directly with experts, both within and outside of EA, in this area that we can learn from.
* Scaling up our anti-cheat team so we have more dedicated resources.
* We are adding a report feature on PC to report cheaters in game that goes directly to Easy-Anti-Cheat.



## We will have to wait for the result, but it's important that Respawn tackles the issue. Let's hope for the best!
