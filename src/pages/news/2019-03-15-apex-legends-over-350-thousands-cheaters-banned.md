Cheaters are a massive problem in the BR genre. Saddly, it is the case for Apex Legends, too. Respawn knows it very well and decided to go on a war against them.

## 355,000 cheaters got banned

"We take cheating very seriously and care deeply about the health of Apex Legends for all players.‚Äù - Apex's community manager Jay Frechette says in his Reddit post. He probably knows it's not gonna be easy, though. Just a simple google search can lead to a lot of results that claim to help you with aiming, wall-hacking and a lot more. Its something everyone that played FPS shooter knows - if the game is free, there are gonna be a lot of cheats and exploits. Of course, we do not encourage you to try and look for them, fair play is always better!

## What's Respawn plan for the Apex Legends future?

They couldn't say much to not to help cheaters prepare for the upcoming patches, but we got some insights directly from Jay:

* We are reaching out and working directly with experts, both within and outside of EA, in this area that we can learn from.
* Scaling up our anti-cheat team so we have more dedicated resources.
* We are adding a report feature on PC to report cheaters in game that goes directly to Easy-Anti-Cheat.

## We will have to wait for the result, but it's important that Respawn tackles the issue and tries to make Apex Legends a better place.
