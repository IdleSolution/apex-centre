Constant crashes is one of the major issue of Apex Legends. Many players faced it on daily-basis, so, after collecting a lot of data, Respawn finally decided to do something with it. "We had never seen the crash in any of our internal testing before, but now we could finally reproduce the bug and that meant we could find it and fix it!" - says Jayfresh, Apex Legends developer.



If you've been experiencing freezing, game crashes with no errors, and a lot more unpleasant things that destroy your fun then we have a great news for you - **New patch that improved the stability of the game is out, you can go and download it right now in your origin client!**



As the game developer says, it's just the beginning of bug-fixing-journey. He doesn't expect the patch to help everyone with crashes, but most of them should have been fixed now. If you are still experiencing them, head over <a href='https://answers.ea.com/t5/Technical-Issues/Crash-after-update-Season-1/td-p/7704502'>here</a> and submit your apex_crash.txt file that can be found in your game files. You will provide useful information that can be used to speed up Apex's development.



## Game performance is the most important thing in the long run, so we hope soon all major problems will be gone and we will be able to play Apex Legends forever!
